**This is binary classification Problem**
# About the data
The dataset is taken from the Kaggle website and predict the the sentiment is positive or negative or netrual
**In the process of data**
After we receive, firstly clean the data,in the process remove the special characters and letter are covert to lower case,
After Data cleaning the next step all the data apply the NLP process the data any charactes and values covert the lowecase and remove the unknwon characters and values,Then i applied the Tdfivectorizer for the text data coverts the array,why because our systems can't analysis the text data thats why we use it.
After the data preprocessing then ready to model bulidig in the process the data divided into train and test and 25% test data and remaing the train data,
after that we used **Logisitc Regression** algorithms because it's classification problems,and also use classification algorithms such as **Decision tree Classification and Randomforest classification ** And finally we get the model accuracy_score
